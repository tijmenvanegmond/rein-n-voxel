# Screenshot Instructions

## How to Add Screenshots to Your Rein-n-Voxel Project

### Method 1: In-Game Screenshots
1. **Run your game** in Godot
2. **Press F12** to take a screenshot
3. Screenshots are automatically saved to `Screenshots/` folder
4. Files are named with timestamps for easy organization

### Method 2: Manual Documentation Screenshots
1. **Take screenshots** using your preferred method (F12 in-game, or external tools)
2. **Save them** to the `Screenshots/` folder
3. **Reference them** in README.md using markdown:
   ```markdown
   ![Description](Screenshots/filename.png)
   ```

### Method 3: External Tools
- Use **Windows Snipping Tool** (Win + Shift + S)
- Use **Steam's Screenshot feature** (F12 if running through Steam)
- Use **OBS** or other recording software for captures

### Recommended Screenshots for Documentation:
- `gameplay.png` - Main gameplay view showing terrain and mobs
- `mob-interactions.png` - Different mob behaviors and factions
- `terrain-editing.png` - Player editing voxel terrain
- `ui-overview.png` - Game interface and controls

### Tips:
- Capture at 1920x1080 or higher for best quality
- Use descriptive filenames
- Keep file sizes reasonable (under 2MB each)
- Show diverse gameplay elements and features

### File Structure:
```
Screenshots/
├── gameplay.png
├── mob-interactions.png
├── terrain-editing.png
